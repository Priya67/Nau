#NAU

Nau allows users to find desired products in nearby stores.

## Core functionalities and features
Nau allows for users to enter a product name and a search radius. Upon querying all the nearby retailer's inventories based on the search inputs, Nau will display either in list view or map view the product and store information.
- (Still deciding on the exact information but at least price and distance.)
- Looking for APIs is our current challenge, as retailers like Target require developers to be Target affiliates. In general, a lot of APIs don't seem available to the public.
- Google map API for the map view
- May need to create a web crawler to extract data from retailer websites for store/product information
