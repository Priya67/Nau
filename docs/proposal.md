# Nau Proposal

Given the absence of Google Shopping as a mobile application, we’ve decided to create a functionally similar mobile application called Nau that will serve as both an availability check and price comparator for products of the user’s choosing in their vicinity.

<br>

Nau allows for users to enter a product name and a search radius. Upon querying all the nearby retailer's inventories based on the search inputs, it will display either in list view or map view the product and store information.

## MVP List

This app will, at a minimum, satisfy the following criteria with smooth, bug-free navigation:

- New user signup and signin + authentication
- Demo website showcasing relevant app features
- User search for a product of interest
- Display of the stores/products that satisfy the search criteria
- Implementing Google Map’s API
- Production README

## Technologies & Challenges

Technologies we are planning to use are the following:
* FrontEnd:
  - ReactJS
  - HTML5
  - CSS3

* BackEnd:
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB(Nosql Database)

<br>
The technical challenges for the application will be:
* Connecting our front-end with mongoDB, i.e. our back-end database
* Correct API calls and understand how to handle the CORS Http requests
* Creating a User interactive and pleasing UI for good user experience

<p>Bonus</p>
Deploy on Play store

## Wireframes
1) Auth page

2) Search page
 * Product input
 * Location input
 * Search radius
 * Whether you need it now (aka only show stores open now)

3) Index page - List view
 * Store name
 * Product availability and price
 * Distance from set location
 * Maybe store hours still?

4) Index page - map view
 * Just show the store name and price

5) Show page
 * Product information/price
 * Store information (business hours and phone number)
 * Ability to save it to a “favorites” list - BONUS

6) Favorites - BONUS

```
NOTES: potential solution/fix to our concern for getting too much data back from queries:
Have all the results from the same store in another show page
